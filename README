Beacontalk is a simple chat program that uses wireless beacon frames to transmit and receive data.

To use Beacontalk, your wireless card has to be in monitor mode. Using the madwifi drivers you can achieve this by entering the following command. 

$ ifconfig wlan0 down; iwconfig mode monitor; ifconfig wlan0 up

Where wlan0 is your wireless device of course. 
To put your wireless card back to normal change 'iwconfig mode monitor' to 'iwconfig mode managed'.
